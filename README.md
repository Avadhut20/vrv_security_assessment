# RBAC User Interface - Admin Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface (UI) for managing users, roles, and permissions in an admin dashboard. The goal of this project is to provide administrators with a user-friendly and secure way to manage users, roles, and permissions dynamically.

### Key Features:
1. **User Management:**
   - View and manage users.
   - Options to add, edit, and delete users.
   - Ability to assign roles to users and manage their status (Active/Inactive).
   
2. **Role Management:**
   - Create and edit roles.
   - Allow roles to include permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes.

3. **Dynamic Permissions:**
   - Assign or modify permissions for roles.
   - Display permissions clearly for easy understanding and modification.

4. **Custom API Simulation (Optional):**
   - Mock API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles.
   - Simulate server responses to validate functionality.
